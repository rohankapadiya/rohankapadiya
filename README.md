👋 Hi, I am Rohan Kapadiya! 💻 I have a solid background in programming skills such as C/C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 📚 I am familiar with software development techniques such as methodologies and agile practices, and have experience in software design, development, and testing.

🔧 I am skilled in various languages, frameworks/environments, database systems, design and IDE tools, and cloud services. 💼 I pursued a Diploma in Computer Programming from Seneca College, where I gained knowledge in Object-Oriented Software Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Services, Web Programming Tools and Frameworks, Software Testing, IT Project Management, and Microsoft Cloud Technologies.

👨‍💻 As a Software Developer Intern at Red & White Multimedia Education, I interacted with clients, collected user feedback, and solved different software needs using analytical skills and critical thinking. 🤝 I worked effectively with colleagues at various levels and participated in reviewing and debugging complex codes, which helped me to learn the basics of testing in a software development Lifecycle (SDLC) environment.

🔨 I have worked on several projects, including EmployeeVue, Jewelry Store and Inventory, Personal Website, and SMS (School Management System). 🌐 These projects showcase my skills in various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, MongoDB, AJAX, and JSON.

💡 I have also participated in a Hackathon and technical events like LeetCode and Coding Ninjas. 🎉 I attended a workshop on the Azure cloud platform under Azure Tech Team and participated in a State Level Tech Event. 🚀
